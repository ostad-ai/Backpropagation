# Backpropagation, pure Python, version 0.0
1. Backpropagation with pure Python. 
- Here, we use no external library to implement a Backpropagation algorithm for a three-layer MLP (Multilayer Perceptron).
2. To use the available code for backpropagation, at the top of your code, write: from bp_pure import *
3. Remember to download **bp_pure.py**.
4. This implementation uses biases for both input and hidden layers.
5. For now, only an online training for backpropagation has been implemented.
6. As an example, download and use **bp_pure_example.ipynb** and **iris.csv** to test the backpropagation algorithm.
